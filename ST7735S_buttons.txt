LCD and the controller

The ST7735S is a 132*162 pixel LCD controller, but the pixel of the 1.44-inch LCD HAT is 128*128. So we have made some processing on the display: the horizontal direction starts from the second pixel to guarantee the location of RAM in the LCD is consistent with the actual location at the same time.
This LCD accepts 8-bits/9-bits/16-bits/18-bit parallel interfaces, which are RGB444, RGB565, and RGB666. The color format used in demo codes is RGB565.
This LCD uses a 4-wire SPI interface for reducing GPIO, and the communication speed will be faster.
